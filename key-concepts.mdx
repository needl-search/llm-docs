One common use case for LLMs is to answer questions about a document or collection of documents. In this case a simple prompt for the document might be something like:

```
Using the following documents, answer the question.

{{ documents }}

Question: {{ question }}
```

The variables 'documents' and 'question' depend on the documents we want to answer questions about and the question we have.

## Test Cases
A test case is a possible usage of our prompt that we want to validate produces our desired output. For example for our use case above, a simple test case might look like:

```json
{
    "input_variables": {
        "documents": "The Acme Corporation was founded in 2021",
        "question": "When was the acme corporation founded?"
    },
    "evaluation_criteria": [
        {
            "match": "2021"
        }
    ]
}
```

`input_variables` provides the values for the variable values in the prompt. In this case, some simple information about the Acme Corporation.

`evaluation_criteria` lets Needl know what factors to grade the LLM's response on. In this case, we simply want to make sure the string '2021' is included in the output.

## Suites

LLM outputs are often unpredictable and changes that improve one test case might cause regressions elsewhere.

In Needl, test cases are grouped into Suites. Suites are lists of test cases for the same prompt. A suite in Needl looks something like:

```json
{
    "name": "Document Answering Test Cases"
    "required_inputs": ["documents", "question"]
}
```

`required_inputs` refers to the variables contained within the prompt. This ensure that all test cases included will work with any new prompts we test.

## Runs

Runs are variations of the prompt and model combinations that you want to test. When you create a run, Needl will run all tests in the targeted suite on the prompt iteration. Runs give you several factors to adjust:

```json
{
    "prompt": [
        {
            "role": "system"
            "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
        },
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Answer the question below. Do not make up information. Only reference information included in the documents provided.\n\n{{ documents }}\n\nQuestion: {{ question }}"
        }
    ],
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "temperature": 0
}
```

Needl will run the tests in the targeted suite, evaluate the criteria, and output a score which you can then use to determine what variation of your prompt performs the best.
