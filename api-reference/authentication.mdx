To use Needl directly through the API, first create your account through the Needl dashboard. You can then reach out to the founders at james@needl.tech and we will generate an API key for you. This a secret key that you should make sure is never exposed. You can then include this key on your requests in the `Authorization` header like so:

```bash
'Authorization': 'Bearer <team_token>'
```

### Permissions

Currently, all members of your organization that you grant access to the Needl platform will have access to all Needl API endpoints. If you require more fine-grained access control, shoot us an email at james@needl.tech
